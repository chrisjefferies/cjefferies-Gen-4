# Hi there

My name is Chris Jefferies and I write HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. IKMNet.com measures my proficiency in the 96th percentile.

I also write some other languages and use some other tools, and I think I'm pretty good. 

This is my portfolio website's source code. I had a bit of a dormant period (where most of my work went into private repositories on bitbucket), but I rebuilt it and pushed a whole new one in 2018.
