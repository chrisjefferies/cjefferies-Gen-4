			<h1>
				About me and what I do
			</h1>
			<p>
				I am a Graphic Designer originally from the Detroit metro area. I hold two associates degrees from Oakland Community College, in Graphic Design and Liberal Arts, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Michigan State University. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I currently live on a farm in Vicksburg, with my wife, son, dog, and tractor. It's not really a farm, but it does have a pole barn. 
			</p>
			<!-- <p>
				Additionally, I am a front-end developer with some degree of programming training supported by a primarily autodidactic formation.
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<h2>
				Trendy jargon aside
			</h2>
			<p>
				If you've made it this far, I'll assume you're interested in what <em>sort</em> of Graphic Designer I am. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Graphic Designer, in my view, while convenient in its utility, is something of a narrow term. 
				While it's a part of what I do, I find it inadequate to describe the full breadth of my trade&mdash;bringing clarity and hierarchy to user interface systems, for instance, depends little on one's ability to place and proportion graphics.
				Similarly, corporate identity design is a strategic exercise that leverages design principles toward specific goals of concentrating and abstracting complex ideas into simple and iconic symbolism that is unique, memorable and replicable.
				 
				While less packed with buzz and jargon, the essence of what I do is <em>visual communication</em>, a more apt descriptor.
			</p>
			<p>
				I apply careful study of design history and principles to the task of accurately transmitting ideas at a distance, reinforcing and embellishing where linguistic solutions, constrained by temporal considerations and flaws inherent in language, fall short.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The primary tools I use today are Adobe Creative Suite and Hypertext Markup. Not long ago it was markers and drafting tools. I expect not long from now it will be something else entirely. 
			</p> -->
			
			<h2>
				Welder, Mechanic and Tinkerer of All Sorts
			</h2>
			<p>
				In as much of my free time as I am able to smuggle away, I like to fire up an old Lincoln Electric welder and melt steel. Some of my projects have even proved useful (I made a bench vise out of a non-working hydralic jack and a Jeep brake rotor). I've also been accused of making art. There's been a time or two where I intended to do so. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I also like to wrench on cars. One of these days, I'm going to cram too large an engine somewhere it rightly does not belong. In the mean time, I mostly just tinker around the edges. I'm getting pretty good a brake and fuel lines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Tinkering with a carburator used to be a national passtime. I'm sometimes jealous I missed that. 
			</p>

			<br style="clear:both;">
			<p>
				Having a decent respect for a quality tool, and a healthy aversion to the price tag that comes with a decent "family heirloom" quality bench vice, I approached my need for one in a non-traditional fashion. When it came time for a new one, I hit the steel yard and scrounged through some scrap metal (in this case, the beefy body of a broken 1 ton floor jack). The SAE threaded rod is good for about 8 tons of clamping force. I don't know if will still work in 100 years, but considering it's 1/4" wall square tube welded with 7018, I'm fairly confident it will still be around.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also occasionally produce some metal art of the manly variety.

			<br style="clear:both;">
			<p>
				Though, more often, I'm working on more conventional projects, like turning a wrench beneath a Chevy half-ton or preparing to swap an LS1 into a WJ.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Having grown up with an engineer and former ameture drag racer for a father, I am also well versed in automotive tinkering. I have built several automotive systems including engines, breaks and exhaust. I am self taught MIG/TIG and Oxy-Asetelyne welder, and excell at basic and intermediate metal fabrication.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, I am also interested in illustration, and am currently authoring an ongoing comic book called Trident 120, a military action thriller.
